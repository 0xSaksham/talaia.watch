## About Us


Donations to Talaia Labs are <b>EXCLUSIVELY</b> used for Bitcoin development with a focus on the Lightning Network. This includes: 

- An open-source and wallet independent implementation of watchtowers
- Pushing forward the standardisation of watchtowers through the Lightning specs, such as [BOLT13](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-November/002350.html)
- Supporting Lightning companies to integrate watchtowers
- Promotion of watchtowers (event, goodies, etc.)
- General education on how the Lightning Network and watchtowers work

The costs associated to run the project, such as hosting, taxes, accounting fees, etc., will be also covered by the donations to the project.
