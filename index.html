        <h2> Supporting Talaia</h2>
        <p><strong>Talaia Labs mission is to work on the security and privacy of the Lightning Network</strong> to ensure it can become a global, censorship-resistant and peer-to-peer payment network.</p>
        <p>Our current focus is providing an <strong>open-source and standardised implementation of Watchtowers</strong> which is a fundamental building block that secures the network. This effort is independent of any lightning wallet provider and its main purpose is to allow users to run and hook to standalone towers.</p>
        <p>Donations contributed to the project are solely destinated to the design and developement of <strong>Watchtowers</strong>.</p>
        <p>Supporters of Talaia Labs will be featured on the website.</p>
